# Anagrams

Two	strings	are	anagrams if	the	letters	can	be	rearranged	to	form	each	other.	For	example,	
“Eleven	plus	two”	is	an	anagram	of	“Twelve	plus	one”. Each	string	contains	one	‘v’,	three	‘e’s,	
two	‘l’s,	etc.

Write	a	program	that	determines	if	two	strings are	anagrams.	The	program	should	not	be	case	
sensitive	and	should	disregard	any	punctuation	or	spaces.	

Pay	attention	to	the	running	time	of	your	program.	If	each	input	string	contains	𝑛
characters,	an	efficient	implementation	would	run	in	a	linear	time	(that	is	Θ(𝑛)).
